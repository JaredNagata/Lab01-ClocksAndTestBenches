The test benches test that the program will start with the right starting clock frequency and it can reduce the frequency to the desired frequency.
It counts the amount of times that the clock goes from low to high through edge triggering.
By knowing how many times it goes from low to high, it knows the new frequency that is being operated.

The first test goes from 100Hz to 2Hz.
The second test goes from 100Hz to 5Hz.
The second test goes from 100Hz to 50Hz.

Here is a screenshot of the GTKWave environment:
